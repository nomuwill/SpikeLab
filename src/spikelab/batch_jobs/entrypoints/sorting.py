    reconstruction ``f.type(**sub_dict)`` would then leave ``Path``-
    annotated fields as ``str`` at runtime (dataclasses do not coerce
    from type hints), and downstream code that does
    ``cfg.recording.intermediate_dir / "subdir"`` would crash with
    ``TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'``.

    This loop re-wraps any field whose static type annotation is
    ``pathlib.Path`` back into a ``Path`` after the
    sub-dataclass is constructed.

        config_dict (dict): Nested dict as produced by
