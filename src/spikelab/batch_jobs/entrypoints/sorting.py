"""Container entrypoint for spike sorting batch jobs.

Invoked as ``python -m spikelab.batch_jobs.entrypoints.sorting``
inside a Kubernetes job container.

Environment variables (required):
    INPUT_URI: S3 URI of the input bundle zip containing recordings +
        sorting_config.json.
    OUTPUT_PREFIX: S3 URI prefix for uploading sorted results.

Environment variables (optional, consulted by the S3 client):
    S3_ENDPOINT_URL: Override the AWS S3 endpoint. Used by
        non-AWS S3-compatible stores (MinIO, Wasabi, etc.). Default:
        unset → boto3 routes to AWS S3.
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: AWS region name passed to ``boto3.client``.
        Required by some AWS regions to disambiguate the endpoint.
        Default: unset → boto3 uses its own region-resolution chain
        (env, profile, instance metadata).

    This loop re-wraps any field whose static type annotation is
    ``pathlib.Path`` back into a ``Path`` after the
