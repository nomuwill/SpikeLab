"""Container entrypoint for workspace-centric batch jobs.

Environment variables:
    INPUT_URI: S3 URI of the input bundle zip.

    Every SpikeLab workspace .h5 written by ``AnalysisWorkspace.save``
    has the ``__workspace_id__`` attribute at the file root (see
    ``workspace.hdf5_io.dump_workspace``). Filename is not canonical
    because ``submit_workspace_job`` preserves the user's chosen base
    path when they pass a string instead of an AnalysisWorkspace
    object, so any .h5 in the bundle could carry an arbitrary name —
    including names that collide with extra ``bundle_input_paths``
    .h5 files like recordings.

    Parameters:
        extract_dir (Path): Directory containing the extracted bundle.

    Returns:
        Path: Path to the unique workspace .h5 in the bundle.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If no .h5 in the bundle has the
            ``__workspace_id__`` attribute.
        RuntimeError: If more than one .h5 in the bundle matches —
