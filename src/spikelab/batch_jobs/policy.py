    """Detect idle-placeholder sleep patterns in batch job commands.

    This is a best-effort heuristic, not a security boundary. It catches
    common idle patterns (``sleep infinity``, ``sleep inf``, bare
    ``sleep``, and ``sleep <large_number>``) but cannot detect arbitrary
    constructs like ``while true; do sleep 60; done`` or obfuscated
    variants. The goal is to flag accidental misuse, not to prevent
    determined circumvention.

    Parameters:
        command (Sequence[str]): The container's command tokens.
        args (Sequence[str]): The container's arg tokens.
        threshold_s (int): Cap (in seconds) above which a bare
            ``sleep <number>`` is considered idle. Defaults to 24h.
            Pulled from ``PolicyConfig.sleep_duration_threshold_s`` by
            ``evaluate_policy``.

    Notes:
        - The bare-``sleep`` check fires only when ``sleep`` is the sole
          token across ``command + args``. A trailing token that
          happens to be the literal string ``"sleep"`` (e.g.
          ``["python", "-c", "sleep"]``, where ``"sleep"`` is a Python
          snippet, not a shell command) is intentionally NOT flagged.
          This avoids false positives on commands that legitimately
          pass the string ``"sleep"`` as an argument. The downside is
          that a determined operator can sneak in a real
          ``exec("sleep infinity")``-style payload; this is documented
          as out-of-scope for the heuristic.
