"""Classified spike-sorting exceptions shared across runners and curation.

Failures from Kilosort2, Kilosort4, and the downstream curation/waveform
code are grouped into three categories so callers can implement retry /
skip / hard-stop policies without parsing generic ``Exception`` messages:

* :class:`BiologicalSortFailure` — the recording itself cannot be sorted
  (too silent, all channels bad, no waveforms to compute metrics on).
  Recommended policy: mark the target as not-sortable, move on, do not
  retry.

* :class:`EnvironmentSortFailure` — the host environment or container
  runtime is misconfigured. Recommended policy: hard stop and surface
  to the operator; retrying without intervention will loop.

* :class:`ResourceSortFailure` — the job exhausted a machine resource
  (GPU memory today; disk/CPU in future). Recommended policy: retry
  with reduced parameters rather than skip or hard-stop.

Classifiers in :mod:`._classifier` inspect sorter logs and exception
chains to re-raise generic failures as one of the specific types below.
The classes are also usable directly from non-classifier paths (e.g.
curation code that already knows the exact condition).

    Kilosort2, Kilosort4, and RT-Sort all fail on near-silent recordings,

    * **Kilosort2:** mex kernels launch with degenerate grid/block
      configurations when template counts and per-batch spike counts
      approach zero. Pre-Blackwell GPUs tolerated these launches; newer
      architectures (compute capability ≥ 12) reject them with
      ``CUDA error: invalid configuration argument``.

    * **Kilosort4:** sklearn's ``TruncatedSVD`` rejects an empty feature
      matrix, or ``KMeans`` fails the ``n_samples >= n_clusters`` check,
      when the initial spike-detection pass finds essentially no events.

    * **RT-Sort:** ``detect_sequences`` produces zero propagation
      sequences when the recording lacks sufficient spiking activity for
      clustering. Returns ``None``, which causes an ``AttributeError``
      when ``sort_offline`` is subsequently called.
