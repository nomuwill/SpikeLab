"""Pipeline canary — short-window smoke test before each full sort.

A multi-hour KS2 / KS4 sort can fail at the MEX / preprocessing stage
hours into the run because of an architecture incompatibility, missing
CUDA kernel, broken Docker image, or any other "first-time" failure
that only manifests once the sorter actually starts processing data.
The fix that already happened to the configured environment is the
goal of the preflight in :mod:`.guards._preflight`; the canary covers
the residual: failures that need the data + the code paths to actually
run end-to-end before they show themselves.

Operation
---------
When ``ExecutionConfig.canary_first_n_s > 0``,
:func:`run_canary` clones the live config, restricts the recording
window to ``[0, canary_first_n_s]`` seconds, turns off post-sort
exporters and figure generation, relaxes curation so a low-yield
window does not falsely fail, and runs the same backend on the same
recording into ``<inter_path>/_canary/``. The MEX compile, model
loads, Docker image start, and the sorter's first preprocessing pass
all execute under realistic conditions — that is the point.

Failure handling
----------------
* **Classified failure** (``InsufficientActivityError``,
  ``BiologicalSortFailure``, ``EnvironmentSortFailure``,
  ``ResourceSortFailure``): returned to the caller so the full sort
  is aborted before launch and the canary's exception is propagated
  as the recording's classified result.
* **Unexpected failure** (anything else, including the canary itself
  hitting OOM or running out of disk): logged but **not** propagated —
  the canary is a smoke test, not a hard gate. The full sort proceeds
  and the live watchdogs handle resource-shaped issues at runtime.

Edge cases
----------
* Recording shorter than ``canary_first_n_s`` → skip is performed by
  the call site in :mod:`spikelab.spike_sorting.pipeline` (where the
  recording duration is known), not inside :func:`run_canary`. If the
  caller invokes :func:`run_canary` on a too-short recording, the
  backend's slicing clamps to the actual duration and the canary
  effectively runs against the whole recording.
* Canary leaves a small amount of intermediate state under
  ``<inter_path>/_canary/``; cleanup is best-effort on success.
