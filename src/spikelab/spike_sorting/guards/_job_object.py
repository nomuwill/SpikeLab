"""Windows Job Object memory cap for the sort process.

On Linux, ``_bounded_host_memory`` uses ``RLIMIT_DATA`` to install a
kernel-enforced cap on anonymous heap allocations. On Windows the
equivalent is a `Job Object`_ assigned to the current process — the
kernel monitors and terminates the process if its committed memory
exceeds the configured ``ProcessMemoryLimit``. This is sharper and
more reliable than the userspace :class:`HostMemoryWatchdog`,
which depends on a daemon thread and ``_thread.interrupt_main``.

.. _Job Object: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/job-objects

The cap is a complement to (not a replacement for) the watchdog:

* The Job Object cap is the **hard kernel limit** — when the
  process tries to commit beyond it, the OS terminates immediately.
* The watchdog still provides early **warn** signals at 85% and a
  graceful **abort** at 92%, with diagnostic capture before the
  hard limit is hit.

Best-effort: the cap is silently a no-op on non-Windows hosts and
when ``pywin32`` is missing. On Windows with pywin32 installed it
is the most reliable way to bound a Python sort process to a
fraction of host RAM.

    """Bound the current Python process to *frac* of host RAM via a Job Object.

    On Windows, creates an anonymous Job Object, attaches the
    current process to it, and sets ``ProcessMemoryLimit`` to
    ``frac * total_host_ram``. The Windows kernel terminates the
    process if its committed memory (private bytes) exceeds the
    cap.

    On non-Windows or when ``pywin32`` is missing, the context
    manager is a no-op and yields ``False``.

    Parameters:
        frac (float): Fraction of total host RAM to cap the process
            at. Defaults to ``0.8`` (80%).

    Yields:
        active (bool): ``True`` when the cap was successfully
            installed; ``False`` otherwise. Useful for telling
            the user whether the kernel-enforced limit is in
            effect.

    Notes:
        - Job Objects are inherited by child processes spawned
          from this one, so a Kilosort2 MATLAB child or RT-Sort's
          multiprocessing workers will share the cap.
        - The Job Object is destroyed when the last handle is
          closed (on context exit or process death), unbinding the
          process from the cap automatically.
