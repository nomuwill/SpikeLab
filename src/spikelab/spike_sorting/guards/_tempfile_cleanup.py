"""Best-effort sweep of leaked temp files at sort end.

When a sort crashes mid-flight (os._exit fired by an in-process
inactivity watchdog, MATLAB child killed, RT-Sort numba kernel
deadlocked) Python's normal ``tempfile`` cleanup hooks may not run
and intermediate files in ``$TMPDIR`` / ``%TEMP%`` are left behind.
Across many crashed sorts this can fill the temp volume.

This module records the temp-folder state at sort start and, on
exit, sweeps any new files matching well-known sorter prefixes.
Best-effort — failures (permission errors, files locked by other
processes) are swallowed.
