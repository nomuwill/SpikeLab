"""Live host-memory watchdog for spike-sorting runs.

The watchdog is a daemon thread that polls
``psutil.virtual_memory().percent`` at a configurable cadence. When the
system memory percentage crosses a *warning* threshold the watchdog
prints a rate-limited notice; when it crosses an *abort* threshold it:

1. Terminates every registered subprocess (e.g. the Kilosort2 MATLAB
   child) so they release their RAM promptly.
2. Calls :func:`_thread.interrupt_main` to inject a
   ``KeyboardInterrupt`` into the main Python thread at the next
   bytecode boundary.

The pipeline catches the resulting interrupt and re-raises it as
:class:`spikelab.spike_sorting._exceptions.HostMemoryWatchdogError`,
which is a :class:`ResourceSortFailure` subclass — so callers can apply
retry/skip policies uniformly with other resource failures.

Discovery
---------
The watchdog publishes itself via a :class:`contextvars.ContextVar` on
``__enter__`` and clears it on ``__exit__``. Backends that spawn child
processes (e.g. the Kilosort2 MATLAB runner) call
:func:`get_active_watchdog` to find the live instance and register
their ``subprocess.Popen`` handle with it. This avoids threading a
watchdog parameter through every backend signature.

Platform notes
--------------
The detection step is fully platform-agnostic — ``psutil`` reads
system-wide pressure on Linux, macOS, and Windows alike. The reaction
step has known limits:

* ``_thread.interrupt_main`` only fires at Python bytecode boundaries.
  A long-running C extension (a single multi-GB ``np.concatenate``,
  a numba ``@njit(parallel=True)`` kernel, a PyTorch CUDA kernel) will
  not see the interrupt until it returns. The watchdog still emits its
  warning, and the abort takes effect as soon as control returns to
  the interpreter.
* Subprocess termination uses :meth:`subprocess.Popen.terminate` then
  :meth:`subprocess.Popen.kill` after a grace period. On Windows the
  MATLAB JVM occasionally ignores the initial terminate; the kill
  fallback handles that.
* If ``psutil`` is not installed the watchdog degrades to a no-op
  context manager so the pipeline still runs.
