"""Native MaxWell HDF5 loader for files that neo cannot open.

MaxWell Biosystems' mxw v25.x firmware writes a ``settings/mapping``
table that occasionally contains duplicate entries for some channel
IDs (e.g. 1021 rows mapping 1019 unique channels).  ``neo``'s
``MaxwellRawIO`` requires unique channel IDs and rejects the file with
``ValueError: signal_channels do not have unique ids for stream 0``,
which propagates through SpikeInterface's ``MaxwellRecordingExtractor``.

This loader bypasses neo entirely: it reads the file with ``h5py``,
dedupes the mapping table by keeping the first occurrence per channel
ID, and returns a SpikeInterface ``BaseRecording`` ready for sorting.
For multi-well files, pass the well/recording ID explicitly or call
``list_maxwell_wells`` first to enumerate them.

The fallback also fires automatically inside
:func:`spikelab.spike_sorting.recording_io.load_single_recording` when
``MaxwellRecordingExtractor`` raises the unique-IDs error, so callers
that already use the standard sort entry points get the workaround
transparently.

    Tries :class:`MaxwellRecordingExtractor` first. When the file's
    ``settings/mapping`` table has duplicate channel IDs (mxw v25.x),

    The extractor path additionally probes the file via ``h5py`` to
    detect a missing HDF5 compression plugin (raising a helpful
    install message) and reconciles routed vs. declared channels via
    ``rec.select_channels``. The native path needs neither because it
    bypasses neo entirely.

    Parameters:

    (file-backed) — the latter is required for Docker-based sorters
    because SpikeInterface's JSON encoder cannot dump in-memory
    ``NumpyRecording`` ndarrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    h5_path : str or Path
        MaxWell ``.raw.h5`` file.
    well_id : str
        Well group name inside ``/wells/``.  Default ``"well000"``
        (single-well MaxOne).  Use :func:`list_maxwell_wells` to list
        what's actually present.
    rec_id : str
        Recording group name inside the well.  Default ``"rec0000"``.
    dtype : str
        dtype of the returned traces.  Default ``"float32"``.
    output_path : str or Path, optional
        When provided, the µV-scaled traces are written as an
        interleaved ``(num_samples, num_channels)`` binary file and a
        ``BinaryRecordingExtractor`` backed by that file is returned.
        Parent directories are created as needed.  When ``None`` (the
        default), a ``NumpyRecording`` is returned — fine for local
        sorters and interactive use, NOT dumpable for Docker.

    Returns
    -------
    recording : BaseRecording
        Single-segment recording with channel IDs (string forms of the
        routed channel numbers), per-channel locations from the
        mapping table, and gains/offsets set so ``get_traces`` returns
        µV-scaled values.

    Notes
    -----
    * Per-channel median centering is **not** applied — that is a
      preprocessing decision the caller can make on the returned
      recording.
    * Mapping table dedupe keeps the first ``(x, y)`` seen per
      channel.  For the MaxOne files where this matters, the
      duplicates have been observed to share the same coordinates
      anyway.
