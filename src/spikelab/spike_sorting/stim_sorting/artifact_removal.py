"""Stimulation artifact removal for offline electrophysiology recordings.

Removes electrical stimulation artifacts from multi-electrode array
(MEA) recordings while preserving neural spikes.  Two methods are
provided:

``"polynomial"`` (default)
    Per-event, per-channel low-order polynomial detrend.  A polynomial
    (default cubic) is fit to the non-saturated samples in the artifact
    tail — after the electrode desaturates — and subtracted.  Because
    the polynomial is far too smooth to capture spike waveforms
    (~0.5-1 ms), spikes riding on the artifact tail are preserved in
    the residual.  Saturated samples are blanked (set to zero).

``"blank"``
    Simply zeros out the entire artifact window.  Crude but useful as
    a quick sanity check or when the artifact is too variable for a
    good polynomial fit.

The polynomial detrend approach is related to SALPA (Suprathreshold
Artifact-Level Polynomial Approximation):

    Wagenaar, D. A. & Potter, S. M. (2002). Real-time multi-channel
    stimulus artifact suppression by local curve fitting. J Neurosci
    Methods, 120(2), 113-120.

SALPA fits a local polynomial in a causal (backward-looking) sliding
window and forward-extrapolates during the artifact, which is necessary
for real-time operation.  This module is designed for offline use, so it
instead looks ahead past saturation and fits the polynomial to the
actual post-saturation recovery curve, yielding a more accurate fit
without the extrapolation drift inherent in SALPA's forward prediction.

Sequential stimulation handling
    When multiple stim events occur in rapid succession (e.g. burst or
    paired-pulse protocols), the signal may re-saturate before reaching
    baseline after the previous stim.  This module dynamically detects
    whether the signal has returned to baseline-like levels after each
    desaturation.  If re-saturation occurs before baseline is reached,
    the blanking region is extended and the polynomial fit is deferred
    until after the final stim in the burst.

    """Derive a saturation threshold (µV) from gain metadata + observed extremes.

    Returns ``+inf`` (i.e. "do not blank anything") when the recording
    shows no evidence of ADC clipping.  Otherwise returns
    ``frac * round(max_uV / gain_uV_per_bit) * gain_uV_per_bit`` — the
    observed rail rounded to a whole number of raw ADC bits and pulled
    in by ``frac``.

    Saturation detection: a hard ADC clip produces many samples pinned
    at the rail (a flat top in the amplitude histogram).  A single
    large spike produces exactly one sample at the maximum.  We count
    samples within one raw bit of ``max(|traces|)``; if fewer than
    ``min_clip_samples``, we treat the recording as unsaturated and
    return ``+inf``.  This means "blank only completely saturated
    electrodes" semantics: high-amplitude artifacts that didn't reach
    the rail are left intact for the polynomial detrend.

    Why use the gain at all (vs. raw ``frac * max(|traces|)``):
      * Read from the recording's ``get_channel_gains()``, which on a
        SpikeInterface chain is propagated from the underlying integer
        extractor (e.g. ``MaxwellRecordingExtractor``).
      * Rounding the observed max to a whole number of raw bits anchors
        the threshold to a hardware-meaningful value, not a
        floating-point artefact of preprocessing arithmetic — two
        recordings of the same probe at the same gain settings produce
        the same threshold.
      * The "within one raw bit of max" tolerance for the clip-detection
        count is also gain-anchored, not arbitrary.

    Parameters:
        recording (BaseRecording or None): SpikeInterface recording
            exposing ``get_channel_gains()``.  When ``None`` or no
            gains available, falls back to a 1.0 µV/bit assumption.
        traces (np.ndarray): ``(channels, samples)`` already scaled to µV.
        frac (float): Fraction of the rail to use as threshold.  Default
            ``0.95`` — leaves ~5% margin so samples within the top bit
            of the rail still count as saturated.
        min_clip_samples (int): Minimum number of samples within one raw
            bit of ``max(|traces|)`` required to consider the recording
            saturated.  Below this, the recording is treated as
            unsaturated and the function returns ``+inf``.  Default
            ``10`` — high enough to ignore single-spike maxima and
            small numbers of outlier samples, low enough to catch even
            very sparse stimulation protocols.

    """Remove stimulation artifacts from multi-channel voltage traces.

    Processes each stim event independently per channel.  Saturated
    samples are always blanked (zeroed).  For the ``"polynomial"``
    method, a low-order polynomial is fit to the post-saturation
    artifact tail and subtracted, preserving neural spikes (which are
    too fast for the smooth polynomial to capture).

    When multiple stim events occur in rapid succession and the signal
    re-saturates before reaching baseline levels, the blanking region
    is extended dynamically and the polynomial fit is deferred until
    after the final desaturation in the burst.

    The polynomial detrend is conceptually related to SALPA (Wagenaar
    & Potter 2002, J Neurosci Methods), adapted for offline processing
    where look-ahead past saturation is available — see the module
    docstring for details.

    Parameters:
        traces (np.ndarray): Raw voltage traces, shape
            ``(channels, samples)``.
        stim_times_ms (array-like): Corrected stim times in
            milliseconds (e.g. from ``recenter_stim_times``).
        fs_Hz (float): Sampling frequency in Hz.
        method (str): ``"polynomial"`` (default) or ``"blank"``.
        artifact_window_ms (float): Maximum duration in milliseconds
            of the artifact tail after the last desaturation point.
            The polynomial is fit over this window.  Default 10.0.

            Note: when the post-stim window contains a clear descent
            from the recentered stim time to a subsequent negative
            peak (typical for biphasic anodic-first pulses sorted with
            ``peak_mode="down_edge"``), the fit is automatically split
            into two independent polynomials at the negative peak —
            one for ``[stim_time, neg_peak]`` (the descent) and one
            for ``[neg_peak, baseline_recovery]`` (the tail).  When
            the recentered stim time IS the negative peak (e.g.
            ``peak_mode="abs_max"`` or ``"neg_peak"``), no descent
            exists and a single fit is used.  This is automatic; no
            user knob.
        saturation_threshold (float or None): Absolute voltage value
            above which a sample is considered saturated.  When None,
            auto-detected — preferring gain-anchored detection from
            ``recording`` metadata when supplied (see ``recording``
            kwarg below), falling back to the 99.9th percentile of
            ``|traces|`` otherwise.
        raw_traces (np.ndarray or None): Optional pre-bandpass traces,
            same shape as ``traces``, used as the source of truth for
            saturation detection.  Bandpass filtering of a stim
            artifact produces ringing whose filtered amplitude can
            exceed the raw ADC rail even on unsaturated samples, so
            auto-detection from ``traces`` (filtered) both over-
            reports (ringing overshoot) and under-reports (group-delay
            smoothing) clips.  When provided, the threshold is derived
            from ``raw_traces`` and the clip mask is built from
            ``np.abs(raw_traces) >= threshold``; the filtered ``traces``
            are blanked at those same sample indices and polynomial-
            detrended around them.
        baseline_threshold (float or None): Absolute voltage envelope
            below which the signal is considered to have returned to
            baseline.  When None, auto-detected from pre-stim MAD.
        poly_order (int): Polynomial order for the detrend.  Default
            3 (cubic).  Higher orders risk fitting spike-like features;
            lower orders may not capture the artifact decay shape.
        artifact_window_only (bool): If True (default), only process
            windows around stim events.  If False, apply a global
            polynomial detrend to the entire trace (for recordings
            with very frequent stimulation).
        copy (bool): If True (default), return a copy; if False,
            modify ``traces`` in-place.
        poly_clamp_factor (float or None): Sanity-clamp factor for the
            ``"polynomial"`` method.  After each polynomial subtraction,
            if any post-subtract sample exceeds
            ``poly_clamp_factor * saturation_threshold`` in absolute
            value, the segment is treated as a divergent fit
            (extrapolated wildly across saturated samples), blanked
            instead of left in place, and counted toward a one-shot
            warning emitted at the end of the call.  Default ``10.0``
            — well above any plausible neural amplitude (~100 µV) when
            ``saturation_threshold`` is in the multi-thousand-µV range.
            Set to ``None`` to disable.  Has no effect when
            ``saturation_threshold`` is ``+inf`` (no clipping detected)
            or ``method="blank"``.

    Returns:
        cleaned (np.ndarray): Cleaned traces, shape
            ``(channels, samples)``.
        blanked_mask (np.ndarray): Boolean array, shape
            ``(channels, samples)``.  True for samples that were
            blanked (zeroed) because they fell within a saturation
            region.
