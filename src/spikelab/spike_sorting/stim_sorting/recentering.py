"""Stimulation time recentering.

Finds the actual stimulation artifact onset near each logged stim time
by detecting a chosen alignment point in the raw voltage traces:

* ``"abs_max"`` (default): sample with the largest ``|voltage|`` across
  channels — appropriate for monophasic pulses where there is a single
  artifact peak.
* ``"pos_peak"`` / ``"neg_peak"``: sample with the largest positive or
  most negative voltage in a top-K summed reference trace.
* ``"down_edge"``: up→down transition of a biphasic anodic-first pulse.
  First finds the negative peak in the search window, then the positive
  peak within a preceding ``prewindow_ms``, then returns the first
  positive-to-negative zero-crossing between them (falling back to the
  steepest negative slope if the signal does not cross zero).  This is
  the moment at which the stim current reverses direction — the AP
  trigger point for biphasic anodic-first protocols.
* ``"up_edge"``: symmetric version for biphasic cathodic-first pulses.

For the signed modes (``pos_peak``, ``neg_peak``, ``down_edge``,
``up_edge``) the reference trace is the *sum* of the top-K highest-
amplitude channels rather than the per-sample max.  Summing preserves
phase information (biphasic transitions add coherently across nearby
channels that see the same artifact; uncorrelated noise cancels) and
yields cleaner derivatives for edge detection.

    in the raw voltage traces and returns the sample at the alignment
    point selected by ``peak_mode``.  This corrects for timing offsets
    between the stimulation hardware trigger log and the artifact in
    the recording.

    Parameters:
        traces (np.ndarray): Raw voltage traces, shape
            ``(channels, samples)``.
        stim_times_ms (array-like): Logged stimulation event times in
            milliseconds.  Need not be sorted.
        fs_Hz (float): Sampling frequency in Hz.
        max_offset_ms (float): Radius of the search window around
            each logged stim time, in milliseconds.  Default 50.0.
        peak_mode (str): Alignment target.  One of:

            * ``"abs_max"`` (default): largest ``|voltage|`` across
              channels.  Backward-compatible with the pre-``peak_mode``
              API.
            * ``"pos_peak"``: largest positive voltage in the top-K
              summed reference trace.
            * ``"neg_peak"``: most negative voltage in the top-K
              summed reference.
            * ``"down_edge"``: up→down transition for biphasic
              anodic-first pulses (see module docstring).
            * ``"up_edge"``: down→up transition for biphasic
              cathodic-first pulses.
        n_reference_channels (int): Number of highest-amplitude
            channels summed to build the signed reference trace for
            non-``abs_max`` modes.  Default ``8``.  Ignored for
            ``abs_max``.
        prewindow_ms (float): For ``down_edge`` / ``up_edge``, radius
            of the pre-window in which to search for the preceding
            opposite-polarity peak.  Default ``5.0``.
        warn_offset_ms (float or None): When the median ``|corrected -
            logged|`` shift exceeds this threshold, emit a
            ``UserWarning``.  A large systematic shift usually means a
            fixed hardware-vs-log delay, a wrong time column in the
            stim log, or a unit mismatch (ms vs s vs samples) rather
            than genuine jitter.  Set to ``None`` to silence.  Default
            ``3.0`` ms — well above one-sample jitter at 20–30 kHz.
        multi_peak (bool): Opt-in support for multi-pulse stim trains.
            When ``True``, the search window is treated as potentially
            containing multiple stimulation pulses (e.g. a 100 Hz
            train), and the alignment target is the **first** or
            **last** qualifying pulse rather than the strongest one.
            Default ``False`` — preserves backward-compatible single-
            peak behavior.
        multi_peak_select (str): When ``multi_peak=True``, which
            qualifying peak to lock onto.  ``"first"`` (default) =
            first pulse onset (matches "first-pulse alignment" used
            for train PSTHs).  ``"last"`` = last pulse onset (useful
            for studying after-train rebound).  Ignored when
            ``multi_peak=False``.
        multi_peak_threshold (float): When ``multi_peak=True``, only
            peaks whose amplitude is at least this fraction of the
            largest peak in the search window are considered "real
            pulses".  Default ``0.6`` — accepts pulses up to 40% weaker
            than the strongest while still rejecting noise.
        multi_peak_min_separation_ms (float): When ``multi_peak=True``,
            the minimum spacing between candidate peaks.  Prevents
            multi-sample peaks of a single pulse from being counted as
            separate pulses.  Default ``2.0`` ms — well below any
            sensible inter-pulse interval (5 ms = 200 Hz; 10 ms =
            100 Hz).

    Returns:
        corrected_ms (np.ndarray): Corrected stim times in
            milliseconds, same length as ``stim_times_ms``.  Events
            whose search window extends outside the recording are
            clipped to the recording boundary.

    Notes:
        * When multiple stim events have overlapping search windows,
          each is recentered independently.
        * For monophasic pulses the ``*_edge`` modes degrade
          gracefully: the pre-window search returns the opposite
          polarity's noise peak and the zero-crossing fallback lands
          near the onset of the single artifact — but ``pos_peak`` /
          ``neg_peak`` will give cleaner results in that case.
        * For single-pulse stim, ``multi_peak=True`` degrades to the
          original single-peak behavior (only one peak in the window
          is above threshold; first==last).  Set it always-on if you
          mix single-pulse and train conditions in one recording.
