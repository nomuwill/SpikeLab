"""Reusable waveform utilities for spike sorting pipelines.

These functions extract the per-spike centering, polarity classification,
and max-channel detection logic so they can be shared across different
sorter backends (Kilosort2, Kilosort4, etc.).

All functions operate on plain numpy arrays or SpikeInterface objects —
they do not depend on any specific sorter's output format.
