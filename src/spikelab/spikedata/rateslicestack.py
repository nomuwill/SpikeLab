class RateSliceStack:
    """A 3D firing rate matrix of shape (U, T, S) with correlation and similarity capabilities.

    U is units (neurons), T is time bins, and S is slices (bursts, events, etc).
    Construct from either a data_obj (SpikeData or RateData) with time
    specifications, or directly from a pre-built event_matrix. The instance
    variables are the same regardless of input option.

    Parameters:
        data_obj (SpikeData or RateData): A data object to slice. Provide
            either this or event_matrix, not both.
        times_start_to_end (list or None): Each entry is a tuple (start, end)
            representing the start and end times of a desired slice. Each
            tuple must have the same duration.
        time_peaks (list or None): List of times as int or float where there
            is a burst peak or stimulation event. Must be paired with
            time_bounds. Alternative to times_start_to_end.
        time_bounds (tuple or None): Single tuple (left_bound, right_bound).
            For example, (250, 500) means 250 ms before peak and 500 ms
            after peak. Must be paired with time_peaks.
        sigma_ms (float): Smoothing factor for computing ISI if you input a
            SpikeData object. Otherwise not used.
        event_matrix (np.ndarray or None): A 3D array of shape (U, T, S).
            Provide either this or data_obj, not both.
        step_size (float or None): Time resolution in milliseconds between
            consecutive time bins. If None, defaults to 1.0.
        neuron_attributes (list or None): List of attribute objects, one per
            unit, containing arbitrary metadata about each neuron.

    Attributes:
        event_stack (np.ndarray): 3D array of shape (U, T, S) where U is the
            number of units, T is the number of time bins, and S is the
            number of slices.
        times (list): List of (start, end) time bounds for each slice, sorted
            chronologically. Length equals S. Example:
            [(100, 200), (500, 600), (1000, 1100)].
        step_size (float): Time resolution in milliseconds between consecutive
            time bins. Inferred from input data. For SpikeData input, defaults
            to 1.0 ms. Example: 1.0 means time bins are at [100, 101, 102, ...]
            ms.
        neuron_attributes (list or None): List of attribute objects, one per
            unit, containing arbitrary metadata about each neuron.

        """Reorder units from earliest to latest peak firing rate across slices.

        Parameters:
            agg_func (str): Either ``"median"`` or ``"mean"``. Used for
                calculating the median/mean time when each unit has peak
                firing rate.
            MIN_RATE_THRESHOLD (float): Minimum peak firing rate for a slice
                to be included in the ordering calculation. Slices where a
                unit's max rate is below this threshold are excluded from
                that unit's typical peak time calculation. Ignored when
                timing_matrix is provided.
            MIN_FRAC_ACTIVE (float): Minimum fraction of slices a unit must
                be active in to be placed in the highly-active group.
                Default 0.0 means all units are in the first group, so the
                second array in each output tuple will be empty.
            frac_active (np.ndarray or None): Optional pre-computed
                fraction-active array of shape (U,) to use for the group
                split instead of the rate-based calculation. Compatible
                sources: SpikeSliceStack.compute_frac_active and
                SpikeData.get_frac_active (frac_per_unit output).
            timing_matrix (np.ndarray or None): Optional pre-computed (U, S)
                timing matrix from get_unit_timing_per_slice. When provided,
                MIN_RATE_THRESHOLD is ignored and this matrix is used
                directly.

        Returns:
            reordered_slice_matrices (tuple of arrays): Tuple of two 3D
                arrays from event_stack with the U dimension reordered
                temporally. The first array is the highly-active group and
                the second is the lower-activity group.
            unit_ids_in_order (tuple of arrays): Two arrays of original unit
                IDs in temporal order (highly-active, low-activity). For
                example, [3, 1, 0, 2] means unit 3 fires first. Use this
                to map back to original unit IDs.
            unit_std_indices (tuple of arrays): Two arrays of standard
                deviation of peak firing rate times (highly-active,
                low-activity). Lower values indicate more consistent timing
                across slices.
            unit_peak_times (tuple of arrays): Two arrays of median/mean peak
                firing time bin (highly-active, low-activity).
            unit_frac_active (tuple of arrays): Two arrays of the fraction of
                slices each unit was active in (highly-active, low-activity).

        Notes:
            - Call get_unit_timing_per_slice first to pre-compute the timing
              matrix if you want to reuse it across multiple calls (e.g.
              rank_order_correlation and this method).

                None, lag is set to 0.
            frac_active (np.ndarray or None): Optional pre-computed
                fraction-active array of shape (U,) to override the internal
                rate-based validity check for computing averages. When
                provided, a unit's average is set to NaN if
                frac_active[u] < (1 - MIN_FRAC). MIN_RATE_THRESHOLD still
                controls which individual slice pairs are computed.
                Compatible sources: SpikeSliceStack.compute_frac_active and
                SpikeData.get_frac_active (frac_per_unit output).
            n_jobs (int): Number of threads for parallel computation. -1 uses
                all cores (default), 1 disables parallelism, None is serial.

        Notes:
            When ``max_lag`` is 0 or None, the inner S x S loop is replaced by
            a vectorized matrix multiplication, which is significantly faster
            for large S. For non-zero ``max_lag``, the S x S comparisons are
            computed in a serial loop per unit (parallelised across units).
            This can be slow for large S (e.g. S > 100).

            n_jobs (int): Number of threads for parallel computation. -1 uses
