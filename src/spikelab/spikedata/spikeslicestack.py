class SpikeSliceStack:
    """A list of SpikeData objects, one per slice, with spike-based comparison capabilities.

    U is units (neurons) and S is slices (bursts, events, etc). Construct from
    either a single SpikeData with time specifications, or directly from a
    pre-built list of SpikeData objects.

    Parameters:
        data_obj (SpikeData or None): A SpikeData object to slice. Provide
            either this or spike_stack, not both.
        times_start_to_end (list or None): Each entry is a tuple (start, end)
            representing the start and end times of a desired slice. Each
            tuple must have the same duration.
        time_peaks (list or None): List of times as int or float where there
            is a burst peak or stimulation event. Must be paired with
            time_bounds. Alternative to times_start_to_end.
        time_bounds (tuple or None): Single tuple (left_bound, right_bound).
            For example, (250, 500) means 250 ms before peak and 500 ms
            after peak. Must be paired with time_peaks.
        spike_stack (list or None): List of SpikeData objects, one per slice.
            All must have the same number of units. Spike times must be
            relative to the slice (0-based or event-centered via
            start_time), not absolute recording times. Provide either this
            or data_obj, not both.
        neuron_attributes (list or None): List of attribute dicts, one per
            unit. If None, inherited from data_obj when available.
        drop_slice_attributes (bool): If True (default), neuron_attributes
            are removed from individual SpikeData slices after construction.
            The shared copy is stored at neuron_attributes. This avoids
            duplicating large per-unit data (e.g. waveform templates) across
            every slice. Set to False to keep per-slice attributes.

    Attributes:
        spike_stack (list): List of SpikeData objects, one per slice. Spike
            times are relative to the slice window. For 0-based slices,
            times run from 0 to duration. For event-centered slices, times
            run from -pre_ms to +post_ms with t=0 at the event. Use
            self.times for absolute recording time positions.
        times (list): List of (start, end) time bounds for each slice in
            absolute recording time, sorted chronologically. Length equals S.
            Example: [(100, 350), (500, 750), (1000, 1250)].
        N (int): Number of units.
        neuron_attributes (list or None): List of attribute dicts, one per
            unit. None if not provided. When drop_slice_attributes is True
            (default), this is the only copy and individual slices will have
            neuron_attributes set to None.

        For each unit in each slice, computes a representative spike time
        (median, mean, or first spike) relative to the slice's time origin. These
        per-slice values are aggregated across slices to obtain a single
        typical timing per unit. Units are then sorted by this value from
        earliest to latest and optionally split into a highly-active group
        and a low-activity group.

        Parameters:
            agg_func (str): How to aggregate per-slice timing values across
                slices. ``"median"`` (default) or ``"mean"``.
            timing (str): Which spike time to extract per unit per slice.
                ``"median"`` — median spike time within the slice (default).
                ``"mean"`` — mean spike time within the slice.
                ``"first"`` — first spike time (onset latency).
                Ignored when ``timing_matrix`` is provided.
            min_spikes (int): Minimum number of spikes for a unit to count as
                active in a slice (default: 2). Ignored when ``timing_matrix``
                is provided.
            min_frac_active (float or None): Minimum fraction of slices a unit
                must be active in to be placed in the highly-active group.
                ``0.0`` or ``None`` (default: 0.0) skips the split entirely
                and places all units in the highly-active group without
                computing activity fractions.
            frac_active (np.ndarray or None): Optional pre-computed
                fraction-active array of shape ``(U,)`` to override the
                internal calculation for the group split. Only used when
                ``min_frac_active > 0``. Compatible sources:
                ``SpikeSliceStack.compute_frac_active`` and
                ``SpikeData.get_frac_active`` (``frac_per_unit`` output).
            timing_matrix (np.ndarray or None): Optional pre-computed ``(U, S)``
                timing matrix from ``get_unit_timing_per_slice``. When provided,
                ``timing`` and ``min_spikes`` are ignored and this matrix is

                ``(highly_active, low_active)`` with units reordered by typical
                timing. The low-activity stack is ``None`` when the group is
                empty.
            unit_ids_in_order (tuple): Two ``ndarray``
                ``(highly_active, low_active)`` of original unit indices in the
                reordered sequence.
            unit_std (tuple): Two ``ndarray`` ``(highly_active, low_active)``
                of standard deviation of per-slice timing values. Lower values
                indicate more consistent timing across slices.
            unit_peak_times_ms (tuple): Two ``ndarray``
                ``(highly_active, low_active)`` of the aggregated typical
                timing in milliseconds relative to slice start. NaN for units
                with no active slices.
            unit_frac_active (tuple): Two ``ndarray``
                ``(highly_active, low_active)`` of the fraction of slices each
                unit was active in.

        Notes:
            - Call ``get_unit_timing_per_slice`` first to pre-compute the
              timing matrix if you want to reuse it across multiple calls
              (e.g. ``rank_order_correlation`` and this method).
            - When ``frac_active`` is None and ``min_frac_active > 0``,
              activity fraction is computed via ``compute_frac_active``.
            - Analogous to ``RateSliceStack.order_units_across_slices`` but
              operates on raw spike trains instead of firing rate curves.

            min_overlap_frac (float or None): Minimum fraction of total units

            n_shuffles (int): Number of shuffle iterations for z-scoring
                (default: 100). Set to 0 to return raw Spearman correlations.
                Values between 1 and 4 are rejected (minimum 5 required for
                a meaningful null distribution).
            seed (int or None): Random seed for reproducibility of the shuffle
                (default: 1).
            n_jobs (int): Number of threads for parallel computation. -1 uses
                all cores (default), 1 disables parallelism, None is serial.
