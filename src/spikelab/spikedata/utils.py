def _count_matching_spikes(times1, times2, delta):
    """Count the number of matching spikes between two sorted spike trains.

    Two spikes are considered matching if they occur within *delta* of each
    other and belong to different trains. Uses a greedy left-to-right scan:
    both trains are traversed simultaneously and the first valid pair
    encountered is consumed, advancing both pointers.

    This algorithm is adapted from SpikeInterface's ``count_matching_events``
    (Buccino et al., eLife 2020; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61834).
    It runs in O(n1 + n2) time and is deterministic given sorted inputs. The
    greedy strategy can yield sub-optimal counts when spikes cluster within
    *delta* of each other. For example, with ``times1 = [10.0, 10.3]``,
    ``times2 = [10.2]``, and ``delta = 0.3``, the algorithm matches
    ``(10.0, 10.2)`` and leaves ``10.3`` unmatched — even though
    ``(10.3, 10.2)`` is a tighter match. A globally optimal assignment (e.g.
    via the Hungarian algorithm) would be O(n^3) and is not used here because
    the Jaccard agreement metric is insensitive to such edge cases when trains
    are well-separated relative to *delta*. This matches the convention used
    by SpikeInterface and SpikeForest.

    Parameters:
        times1 (np.ndarray): Sorted spike times for train 1.
        times2 (np.ndarray): Sorted spike times for train 2.
