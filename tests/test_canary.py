"""Tests for ``spike_sorting/canary.py`` — short-window smoke test.

Covers:

* ``_build_canary_config`` — relaxed config clone with overrides
  applied + original config left untouched.
* ``_wipe_canary_folder`` — best-effort cleanup of the canary's
  intermediate folder.
* ``run_canary`` — early-return on disabled / NaN window, classified
  failure propagation, success cleanup, unexpected-exception swallow,
  and KeyboardInterrupt / SystemExit re-raise.
* The pipeline-side recording-too-short-skip contract documented in
  the canary module docstring.

# TestRunCanaryGlobalsIsolation removed in Phase 5 of the _globals.py
# refactor (iat/TO_IMPLEMENT.md). The canary's snapshot/restore helpers
# (`_snapshot_pipeline_globals` / `_restore_pipeline_globals`) and the
# `_globals.py` module itself were deleted: the canary now isolates its
# state via the deep-copied SortingPipelineConfig clone returned by
# `_build_canary_config` instead of mirroring overrides through globals.
# The state-isolation contract is exercised by TestBuildCanaryConfig
# (above), which verifies `_build_canary_config(config, ...)` does not
# mutate its input.
